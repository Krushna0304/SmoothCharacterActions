# Basic Character Controller Game

A simple yet effective third-person game prototype that demonstrates core character movement and combat mechanics using **Finite State Machine (FSM)** and **Unity’s Animation Controller** system. This project is designed with smooth animation transitions and modular code, making it an excellent foundation for more advanced gameplay systems.

## 🎮 Features

- Responsive and smooth character movement
- Integrated animations for:
  - Walking
  - Running
  - Jumping
  - Fighting
- State-based logic using Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Clean transition between animation states using Unity Animator
- Easy-to-understand code structure, perfect for learning or extension

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Unity** (Game Engine)
- **C#** (Scripting Language)
- **Unity Animator Controller** for managing animations
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for managing character behavior
- **Mixamo** for high-quality character models and animations

## 📦 Assets Used

- Character model and all animations (walk, run, jump, fight) are from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com)
- Custom FSM and animation logic built for Unity

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Each action like walking, running, jumping, and fighting is handled through a well-structured FSM.
- **Animator Controller:** Smooth transitions between states and layered animations handled via Unity’s Animator tool.
- **Character Animation:** Realistic and responsive animations from Mixamo, integrated and synced for seamless gameplay.
